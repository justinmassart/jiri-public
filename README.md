# Jiri

This repo is a copy of the main repo which is private.

This project is a school project for an exam. The goal was to create an app to manage juries for school projects.

By managing juries it means being able to :

- Create a jury by adding people and choose their identity in the jury (evaluator or student);
- Adding projects to a jury with their own rating system;
- Starting a jury and notify the evaluators;
- Have a private part of the app for each evalutors to evaluate students and their projects;
- ...

This app was made using Laravel and Livewire, the css part was made very quickly and skipped because I wanted to spend more time in the backend.
